<h1>The Best Books to read as a Christian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Books of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Purpose Driven Life By Rick Warren</h3>
<p>This is my favourite book. It literally tells you why you're here on earth. It allows you to find purpose if you haven't find one yourself.</p>
<h3>The Lifestyle of Faith By Bishop David Abioye</h3>
<p>If you're living in the Gen Z, you should probably need faith to operate. To avoid living your life in daily fear, you need faith. And this book offers you everything you need to over</p>
<h3>Satan Get Lost By Bishop David Oyedepo</h3>
<p>Many people feel that until they encounter a road block before they know something about satan. Yes he's basically walking up and down, to and fro the earth. You need to understand the tactics on how he operates to guide yourself. This book helps you on that.</p>
